                <h3 class="heading heading--m">Competence By Java</h3>
                <p>
                  Our Java group in Gothenburg is currently doing a mob programming inspired workshop series.
                  We have a concept where we work with a Spring Boot microservice and for each session we have a main topic (e.g. persistence, security, etc.)
                  which we incorporate in the microservice. You can find and follow the project here <a href="https://github.com/SigmaITC/competencebyjava-microservice-springboot">Sigma ITC CompetenceByJava - Spring Boot Microservice </a>.
