    description: "The key to writing good HTML is a fundamental understanding of semantics. It is essential to know how to properly use &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;. How &lt;table&gt; is intended to be used and how it is usally abused. How to correctly structure headings. Using &lt;form&gt; and &lt;input&gt; as well as all input field types and validation rules. Make good valid decisions wether to use &lt;a&gt; or &lt;button&gt;. Lastly, avoiding to go overboard with &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;."

        Sanctuary is a JavaScript functional programming library inspired by Haskell and PureScript. It's stricter than Ramda, and provides a similar suite of functions.
        <br/><br/>
        Sanctuary promotes programs composed of simple, pure functions. Such programs are easier to comprehend, test, and maintain – they are also a pleasure to write.
        <br/><br/>
        Sanctuary provides two data types, Maybe and Either, both of which are compatible with Fantasy Land. Thanks to these data types even Sanctuary functions which may fail, such as head, are composable.
        <br/><br/>
        Sanctuary makes it possible to write safe code without null checks. In JavaScript it's trivial to introduce a possible run-time type error.
